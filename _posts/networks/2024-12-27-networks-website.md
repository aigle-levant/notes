A **website** is a collection of webpages which has an unique domain [or IP address] name.

It's made up of 2 categories of files :

- Code files : Source codes
- Assets : Images, music, videos, etc.

## Webpage

It is a document made up of HTML, CSS, JS and other front-end stuff. It can be displayed in a browser.

Webpages embed various resources inside themselves :

- A page's appearance is determined by its style info.
- Scripts made using JS, ReactJS, etc. make a page interactive.
- Media like images, sounds, etc. can be added to a webpage.

Each webpage in a website has clickable links [called explicit links] that lead to other pages of the same website.

### Homepage

The main page of a website is called a homepage.

## Domain names

A domain name consists of two parts :

- Top-Level Domain [TLD]
- Label or Secondary-Level Domain [SLD]

Eg : In `imissmycafe.com`, `.com` is the TLD and `imissmycafe` is the label.

### Top-Level Domain [TLD]

It indicates the purpose of the service provided by a particular website.

Eg : `.com`, `.in`, `.io`, `.gov`, etc.

Certain TLDs are used by certain organisations. Government websites use `.gov`, academic institutions use `.edu` for their websites, etc.

Local TLDs like `.de`, `.fr`, etc. require the domain to be in a particular language [or hosted in a particular country].

Eg : `auda.org.au` is an Australian website.

### Label

It is a case-insensitive [meaning, uppercase or lowercase don't matter] sequence of character that tells us which page have we landed into.

Eg : `app.flocus.com`, `genshin-impact-map.appsample.com`, `agar.io`, etc.

## Web server

It is a computer [or an actual server] that hosts websites. Hosting here means making the website and its files available in the internet. Many websites can be hosted in a single server.

If a website's down, it means its server is not responding.

## Search engine

A search engine is a service that helps you find a website. It can be accessed using a browser.

Eg : Google, DuckDuckGo, Bing, etc.

### Browser

It's a software that retrieves and displays webpages.

Eg : Google Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.
