Internet is the world's largest network, using which computers can communicate with each other.

## World Wide Web [WWW]

WWW, W3 or The Web was created in the CERN laboratory in Switzerland by a man named Tim Berners-Lee and his team in 1991.

It is a hypertext-based system, which means HTML is involved in it. It has several components like HTTPS, URL, etc.

It consists of inter-connected public webpages. These webpages can be accessed using the internet.

### Are internet and WWW the same thing?

Nope.

Internet is the hardware on top of which is WWW and several other services.

WWW is a way data, services, webpages can be accessed, organised and addresse. Simply put, it's a service that can't exist without the internet.

## Network

A network is a set of computers that share resources like files and information with each other and communicate.

### Router

Computers are connected using a router, which ensures that messages from one computer are sent to its right destination [another computer].

> Routers can be connected to routers.

### Modem

**Modems** are used to connect network to the rest of the world via telephone infrastructure. They use a process called **modulation**, which converts digital signals to analog info.

Its reverse process is called demodulation.

### ISP

We connect our network through the modem to an **Internet Service Provider [ISP]** to access the internet. They manage routers which access other ISP's routers.
