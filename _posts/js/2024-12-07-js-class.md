Classes were introduced in JS with ES6. They function the same as object constructors and prototypes.

## Classes : Java vs JavaScript

Unlike the classes in Java with special mechanisms...

```java
public class player
{
    private String name;
    private String job;
    //other instance variables

    public player(String name, String job /*other parameters*/)
    {
        this.name = name;
        this.job = job;
    }

    public void playerInfo()
    {
        //definition goes here
    }
}
```

Classes in JS are just a function [almost everything in this beautiful language is a function for some reason].

```js
class Player
{
    constructor(playerName, playerJob, /*other parameters*/)
    {
        this.playerName = playerName;
        this.playerJob = playerJob;
        //other properties
    }
    playerInfo()
    {
        //method definition goes here
    }
}
```

We can verify our previous claim of classes being a function with this :

```js
alert(typeof Player); //function
```

`class Player` creates a function named `Player`, whose code is derived from the constructor method.

The other class methods such as `playerInfo()` are stored in the `Player.prototype` so that when an object is created and a method is called using it, it is obtained from the `Player.prototype`.

### Then why not use an object constructor and be done with it?

There are a couple of reasons why classes were introduced by ES6. Here's why :

A function created by `class` [defining a class] is labelled by a property called `[[IsClassConstructor]]: true`.

Its string representation is different from that of object constructors :

```js
console.log(Player); //[class Player]
console.log(PlayerAlt); //[Function: PlayerAlt]
```

Class declaration can only be invoked using `new`.

And many more.

## Creating objects

After defining a class like the above one, we create an object and use methods with it :

```js
let pOne = new Player("Jean Antonique", "Ranger", /*other args*/);

pOne.playerInfo(); //prints player info
```

## Getters and setters

Getters are methods that return a value of the object.
Setters are methods that set a value of the object to something else.

```js
class Player
{
    constructor(playerName, playerJob /*parameters*/)
    {
        this.playerName = playerName;
        this.playerJob = playerJob;
        //other properties
    }
    getName()
    {
        return this.playerName;
    }
    setName(newName)
    {
        this.playerName = newName;
    }
}
```

## Class expression

Just like functions, classes can be defined in a variable, passed as argument, returned, etc.

```js
let Player = class
{
    //definition
}

function makePlayerClass(details)
{
    return class
    {
        playerInfo(details)
        {
            console.log(details);
        }
    }
}

let player = makePlayerClass(details);
new player().playerInfo();
```

## `extends`

`extends` is used to create a class which is the child of another pre-existing class. To put it shortly, it allows a class to extend a new class, just like an octopus extends its tentacles.

```js
class playerInjuries extends Player
{
    //definition
}
```

## Private properties

Now JS has a feature similar to `private` instance variables in Java.

```js
class Player
{
    #playerInfectionPercentage = 10.00;

    #playerFullyInfected()
    {
        if (#playerInfectionPercentage==100.00)
        {
            #endGame("Infected");
        }
    }
}
```
