npm is a package manager that may seem similar to Node Package Manager, but it is.

> "Contrary to popular belief, npm is not in fact an acronym for "Node Package Manager"; It is a recursive bacronymic abbreviation for "npm is not an acronym" (if the project was named "ninaa", then it would be an acronym)."

> - npm website

npm is previously based on a bash utility named pkgmakeinst [package make instant] or pm. Hence, npm is best called node pm or new pm.

npm is widely used in static web-page generators such as Jekyll, Vercel, etc.

## `package.json`

It is a JSON file containing information about our project - its name, dependencies, version number, etc.

```json
{
  "name": "my-awesome-package",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "author": "Your Name <email@example.com> (https://example.com)"
}
```

To create a `package.json` file, navigate to the root directory of where you'd like the package to be in the command line and run :

```cmd
npm init
```

Then answer the questions that come up next and you're done!

If you don't want to spend time answering questions and get the default values, do this :

```cmd
npm init --yes
```

You'll get the following JSON file :

```json

{
  "name": "my_package",
  "description": "make your package easier to find on the npm website",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "repository": {
    "type": "git",
    "url": "https://github.com/monatheoctocat/my_package.git"
  },
  "keywords": [],
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "bugs": {
    "url": "https://github.com/monatheoctocat/my_package/issues"
  },
  "homepage": "https://github.com/monatheoctocat/my_package"
}
```

To add custom questions, create a file `.npm-init.js` and add questions with the `prompt()` function :

```js
module.exports = prompt("Purpose of usage?", "Personal");
```

To add custom fields, do the following in the same file :

```js
module.exports =
{
    fieldName: "Stuff",
    fieldNameTwo: "Again, stuff"
}
```
