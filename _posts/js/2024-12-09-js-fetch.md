Fetch API is a tool which provides a JavaScript interface called a `Request` for fetching resources across the internet.

> `Request` is an interface which tells you which resource is being requested from whom in the internet.

We use `fetch()` to make a HTTP request to a browser and to fetch resources from that browsers. In this method, we pass a `Request` object or the URL from which we need to fetch resources from.

It returns something called a `Promise`, which I cover in detail [here](2024-12-09-js-promise.md).

This `Promise` is then fulfilled with a `Response` object, which represents a server's response to what happened just now.
