## Tuples

Tuple is an ordered collection that can't be changed.

- Duplicate values are allowed.
- Can be of any data types.
- Belong to class `tuple`.
- Negative indexing is allowed.

`len()` is used to find length of tuple.

```py
songs = ("What Would You Do", "Shame", "Hangin'")
print(len(songs)) # 3
```

To create a tuple with only one item, add comma after the item.

Access tuple items using their index number :

```py
print(songs[2]) # Hangin'
```

You can specify a range of indexes the same way you do in lists.

```py
mountain_sound = ("Hold your horses now", "we sleep until the sun goes down", "Through the woods, we ran", "deep into the mountain sound")
print(mountain_sound[1:3])
"""
('we sleep until the sun goes down', 'Through the woods, we ran')
"""
```

Use `in` operator to check if item exists in tuple.

```py
i = 0
if "hold" in mountain_sound:
    print("yes")
# yes
```

Although tuples are immutable, they can be converted into list to change them, then converted back to tuple.

```py
lyrics = list(mountain_sound)
lyrics.append("We sleep until the sun goes down")
new = tuple(lyrics)
print(new)
"""
('Hold your horses now', 'we sleep until the sun goes down', 'Through the woods, we ran', 'deep into the mountain sound', 'We sleep until the sun goes down')
"""
```

Or, we can use single-value tuple and add it to current tuple.

```py
lyrics = ("We sleep until the sun goes down",)
mountain_sound += lyrics
print(mountain_sound)
"""
('Hold your horses now', 'we sleep until the sun goes down', 'Through the woods, we ran', 'deep into the mountain sound', 'We sleep until the sun goes down')
"""
```

Use the same workaround to remove items.

```py
lyrics = list(mountain_sound)
lyrics.pop(2)
new = tuple(lyrics)
print(new)
"""
('Hold your horses now', 'we sleep until the sun goes down', 'deep into the mountain sound')
"""
```

Assigning values to it is called packing a tuple. If we extract values back into variable, we unpack a tuple.

```py
bastille = ("Weight of Living Pt. I", "Glory", "Of The Night")
(a, b, c) = bastille
print(a) # Weight of Living Pt. I
print(b) # Glory
print(c) # Of The Night
```

Use an asterisk if variables are lesser than number of values.

```py
bastille = ("Weight of Living Pt. I", "Glory", "Of The Night", "Shame", "Pompeii")
(a, b, c) = bastille
print(a) # Weight of Living Pt. I
print(b) # Glory
print(c) # ['Of The Night', 'Shame', 'Pompeii']
```

Use `for` and `while` loops to iterate through the tuple.

```py

for i in bastille:
    print(i)
"""
Weight of Living Pt. I
Glory
Of The Night
"""

i = 0
while i < len(bastille):
    print(bastille[i])
    i +=1
"""
Weight of Living Pt. I
Glory
Of The Night
"""
```
