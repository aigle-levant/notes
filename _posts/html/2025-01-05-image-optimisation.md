Refer -> [How to Optimize Images for Web: A Step-By-Step Guide for Better Site Performance | WP Engine](https://wpengine.com/resources/optimize-images-for-web)

Image optimization is the act of decreasing file size without losing quality.

It's important for 2 reasons :

- To get faster load times as a result of smaller file size.
- To make the most of the limited server storage for your website.

## Steps taken for optimization

### Benchmark your site's speed

Benchmark your site's speed using tools like [PageSpeed](https://pagespeed.web.dev/?utm_source=psi&utm_medium=redirect) and [WebPageTest](https://www.webpagetest.org/).

### Image file type

- **JPEG** : Best for showing complex colour photographs. Doesn't work with transparent backgrounds.
- **PNG** : Used for flat illustrations, icons, logos or images with transparent background.
- **GIF** : Just...think why would you use this.

Use tools like Photoshop for this purpose.

### Resize images before uploading

Crop or resize images with massive resolutions to reduce their size and save disk space.

Use tools like Canva or the built-in image editing software to do this.

### Compress images

Compressing images makes their size smaller and doesn't reduce their quality.

There are 2 types of compression :

- Lossless compression : Maintains same level of quality before and after compression.
- Lossy compression : Discard elements of a photo in a way the human eye won't notice.

Use tools like [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/) for this purpose.

### Blur up to load a lower quality image first

Load a lower quality image first to let the user look at something while they wait for the details. One way to do this is to 'blur up'.

### Lazy loading
