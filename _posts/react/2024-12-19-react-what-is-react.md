React is the poster child of how web development has reached new highs that weren't thought as possible in the early 2000s.

## What is React?

Be sure to visit their [docs](https://react.dev/learn)

Just like Bootstrap and Tailwind are libraries [or more properly, frameworks] for CSS, **React** is a library for JavaScript. It deals with web and native user-interfaces [UIs].

Here, native means the thing built with React is going to use the native components of its platform, instead of relying on web-based ones.
{: #myid .alert .alert-info .p-3 .mx-2 mb-3}

So, React lets you make UI out of many pieces called components. You combine them into entire screens, pages, websites, apps...anything! Why, you can make your stuff be awesome in both web [using simple React] and mobile [using React Native]!

### Questions

- What is React?
- What does React deal with?
- What does 'native' mean in React Native?
- What is a React component?

## React alone is enough to save my day!...oh wait

React alone won't do, as their [website states](https://react.dev/). Just like having a raw turkey alone won't give a full turkey dinner, to build an entire app with it you need something advanced like **Next.js**, etc. with it.
