Botnets are used to do the following :

- **Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks** : Overwhelming a system with traffic from the botnet.
- **Spamming** : Sending out large volumes of spam emails.
- **Data theft** : Harvesting sensitive info. from the zombie.
- **Click fraud** : Generating fake clicks, views, etc.
