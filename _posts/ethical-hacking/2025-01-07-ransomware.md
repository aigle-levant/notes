Ransomware is a malware that encrypts a user's files and demands a ransom payment for the decryption key. It is done so that paying the ransom is far cheaper than the other alternatives.

Eg : WannaCry, Scorpion virus, etc.

## Types

- **Leakware / Doxware** : Steals sensitive data [like private photos, credit card info.] and threatens to publish it unless ransom is paid.
- **Wipers** : Threatens to destroy data if ransom isn't paid; sometimes destroys data even if it's paid; used by nation-state actors or hacktivists.
- **Scareware** : Poses as an authoritative figure and demands a fine; uses social-engineering to make the user purchase ransomware disguised as antivirus software.
