A computer infected by Trojan becomes a zombie computer. Hackers can control it to share the malware across many devices to create a botnet.

### Types

- **Backdoors** : Creates remote access to system; used after a system hacking for ease of access.
- **Spyware** : Watches you enter sensitive info. to steal them.
