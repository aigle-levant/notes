[Refer -> [What is Spoofing â€“ Definition and Explanation | Kaspersky](https://www.kaspersky.com/resource-center/definitions/spoofing)]

Spoofing is the act of impersonating a legitimate source by forging the sender's info. This legitimate source could be a business, colleague, other trusted contacts.

This is done to manipulate the user to do something beneficial to the attacker, but detrimental to the user.

## Elements

There are 2 elements involved :

- **Spoof** : A fake email or website
- **Social-engineering** : Nudging and manipulating the user to take action

## Types

- **Email spoofing** : Sender forges email headers to appear legitimate. This relies heavily on social-engineering.
- **IP spoofing** : Attacker takes a legitimate host's IP address, alters the packet headers sent from their system and gain unauthorised access to a system by sending messages with it.
- **Called ID spoofing** : Scammer falsifies info sent to your caller ID using Voice over Internet Protocol [VoIP].
